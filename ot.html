        <div class="about-text text-center">
          <p>For over 20 years Electrika has provided free estimating software to the electrical sector powered by a database of around 300k products. About 3 years ago, I noticed a gap in the market, as most if not all of the manufacturers we worked with struggled to provide us and others with good quality product data. </p>
          <p>We decided to poivit the company and create a new SASS product to focus on solving this problem. OneTime PIM, as it’s known is a product information management tool designed to help marketing teams import, manage and share product data that’s as simple as a spreadsheet but with the power of a graph node database.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <div class="about-text text-center">
      <p>I was responsible for the collection and the understanding of the market, business requirements, user research, prototyping and design of a new mobile responsive single page webapp.</p>

      <p>In addition to leading the UX process I also guided a team of three developers thought the full software development life cycle using JIRA sprint boards and the agile methodology.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <div class="about-text text-center">
      <p>Manufacturers often store their product data in multiple separate data silos like enterprise resource planning (ERP) for storing basic data such as part numbers and descriptions. Content Management Systems (CMS) for rich content such as features / benefits, images and media. Ecommerce for sales and transactions information.</p>
      <p>Onboarding new products can take months and is done in stages, staff often forget to update all of the silos and the data becomes out of sync. In addition designers creating the print catalogues will regularly improve the data but not feedback changes to rest of business.</p>
      <p>This means data is often missing or wrong. OneTime PIM needed to be the one source of data that updated every other database but it also needed to be the easiest to use.</p>

                <p>I started by arranging video calls with some of our existing customers to show me how they currently manage product data and the problems they face day to day.</p><br>

                  <p>I took lots of notes and created a mind map using MindView. This helped me prepare detailed interview questions and usability test scripts and competitive benchmarking.</p><br>
                  
                 <p>Interviews were conducted onsite and record for later reference. I was able to identify that in almost every case the systems tested did not meet the mental model of what the test subjects expected. For example, to add an attribute value to a range of products in a family in excel its as simple as copying the cell down but most of the systems we tested required the export, modification and re import of the data.</p><br>
                 <p>I did a survey of our customers to identify any additional pain points of the product data management process. I identified the fact than on average 6 people would need work on the data at anyone time and that the process was done in stages.</p><br>
                 <p>After reviewing the material I ran an affinity diagram session to cluster and bundle my ideas.</p><br>

                <p>After performing my initial research I used Adobe XD to create personas of each of the stakeholders to help me keep the users always in my mind throughout the process.</p><br>
                <p>
                  After defining of the features needed, I ran a card sort using post-it notes to better understand where each of the functions live within the application. While doing the card sort I realised that we could cut down on screens making navigation much simpler by using contextual states and slide out panels.</p><br>
                  <p>I used Adobe XD to create a high level user flow of how marketing person would use the system. This helped me define goals, behaviors and pain points for each of the steps.</p>

                <p>I used A4 plain paper and a sharpie pen to sketch out the main screens I knew I would need such as home, import, manage, and the share page and created a paper based prototype that was then able to perform simple user tests on.</p>
                <p>I used Draw.io and Adobe XD to iterate and to test ideas with the team, and then I created a low fidelity flow diagram of the most likely user journeys as outlined in the image below.</p>

                <p>I used Adobe XD to create a medium fidelity prototype of the main user flows for each of the personas and screen sizes.</p><br>
                <p>I ran user testing with this medium fidelity to confirm user flows, interactions and app sate’s.</p><br>
                <p>
                  I defined a design system using the “Atom” methodology and applied this to a high fidelity prototype before re-testing.</p>
                <p>I also used invision and protopie for this process.</p>

              <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>I tested the high fidelity prototype and recorded the sessions using Camtasia. The feedback we were getting was that even though it was much easier to use the other tools it still seemed like a complex application. We reworked the design to only display features and tools contextually to make sure the use did not feel overwhelmed. </p>
                <p>Also we created a beta/prototype of the “Spreadsheet View” and made it available to our customers within the production environment to validate our thinking. To collect as much data as possible we installed Hotjar to watch how users would interact with it.</p> <br>
                <p>We also did some A / B testing to validate the best way to approach such as data views, images etc.</p><br>

          <p>It was clear from my research with the field service engineers that offline access and the speed of quote creation was their top priority. To achieve this we built a background downloading/syncing that made sure when they arrived at the site they had everything they needed.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In addition, we reduced the number of inputs needed by 80% by introducing context-aware defaults and adding features such as “Recently used materials”</p>
          <br>
          <p>It was also clear that management needs to be able to have full visibility of each of the regions and users performance via the web app version of the tool.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This was made even more difficult by the fact that service engineers are based on the road and at the time only provided with 13in Dell Thinkpads. They also needed to dial into a secure FTP server to access Lotus Notes, which proved extremely difficult as some sites strictly forbid the use of the Internet for national security reasons.</p>
